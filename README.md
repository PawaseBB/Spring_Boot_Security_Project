## Getting Started

This project serves as a foundation for implementing Spring Security in your web application. It provides a basic structure for user authentication and role-based access control.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Apache Maven installed
- MySQL database server
- Your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spring-security-demo.git
   ```

2. Create a MySQL database and update the database configuration in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database_name
   spring.datasource.username=your_username
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```

3. Build the project using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

## Configuration

- Security configuration can be found in `src/main/java/com/example/securitydemo/config/SecurityConfig.java`. Modify this file to configure your security settings, such as custom login pages, access control, or authentication providers.

## Database Setup

This project includes an SQL script to create the necessary database and schemas. Follow these steps to set up the database:

1. Open your preferred MySQL client or command-line tool.

2. Create a new database using the MySQL client or command-line:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
   ```

   Replace `your_database_name` with your desired database name.

3. Use the newly created database:

   ```sql
   USE your_database_name;
   ```

4. Execute the SQL script provided in the project to create the required tables and schemas. You can find the script in `Spring_Boot_Security_Project
/Join_of_users_authorities.sql`.

   ```Spring_Boot_Security_Project
/Join_of_users_authorities.sql
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory.

5. Your database is now set up with the necessary tables and schemas for this project.

Make sure to update the `spring.datasource.url`, `spring.datasource.username`, and `spring.datasource.password` properties in the `application.properties` file with the correct database connection details.

For more advanced database configurations or if you encounter any issues, refer to the [Spring Boot documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-embedded-database-support) on configuring databases.

## Usage

1. Run the application using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

3. You can log in with the following default credentials:

   - Username: `user`
   - Password: `password`

4. Explore the application and customize it to your needs. You can add more roles, users, and protected resources as required.
